<li>While the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s permitted fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee.</li>
<li>Fees charged for “value-added services” can arise between an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source and Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> User.</li>
<li>Fees charged must be based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to all similarly situated <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> users. The requirement of objective and verifiable criteria to determine the application of fees to “similarly situated” <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Users is meant to prevent one customer or a specific group of customers to whom the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology is supplied or for whom it is supported from bearing an unreasonably high cost compared to other customers, which could lead to “special effort” for accessing and using <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> (85 FR 25753).</li>
<li>Discounted fees, or other fee calculation methodologies, used for the licensing or selling of certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology are not prohibited under the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Health IT Certification Program so long as they result in fees that meet all the requirements of 45 <abbr title="Code of Federal Regulations">CFR</abbr> <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(3) in the context of the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Health IT Certification Program.</li>

<li>Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software developer may reasonably require to make effective use of certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology for any legally permissible purpose.</li>
<li>Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person’s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. These services could include, for example, access to “test environments” and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the information needed to connect to certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the ability to dynamically register with an authorization server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fees for requirements beyond what a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy applications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that interact with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology, and can be classified as permitted fees for value-added services as finalized in § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(3)(iv).</li>

<li>Regarding the use of the term “developing” in § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(3)(ii), fees for “developing” certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology comprise the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s costs of designing, developing, and testing certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. Fees for developing certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology must not include the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s costs of updating the non-<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> related capabilities of the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s existing Health IT Modules, including its databases, as part of its development of the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology.

<ul>
<li>“Usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to recover costs typically incurred for supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. That is, “usage-based” fees recover costs incurred by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer due to the actual use of the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology once it has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology).</li>
<li>A Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's “incremental costs” comprise the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's costs that are directly attributable to supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels.</li>
<li>A Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer should “price” its costs of supporting access to the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology by reference to the additional costs that the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer would incur in supporting certain volumes of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> use.</li>
<li>Usage fees for certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology will only apply when the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer acts on behalf of the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source to deploy its certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. In scenarios where the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source’s sole responsibility, and a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees.</li>
<li>The costs recovered under “usage-based” fees can only reflect “post-deployment” costs. As such, “usage-based” fees cannot include any costs necessary to prepare and “get the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology up, running, and ready for use,” which are costs that must be recovered as part of the deployment services delivered by the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer if permitted under § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(3)(ii).</li>
<li>We clarify that <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> usage fees related to <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for multiple patients would be calculated using a similar methodology to calculate <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> usage fees related to <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for single patients. These “usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to recover the costs typically incurred to support <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions for <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> “read” services for multiple patients once these services have been deployed. This could include, but not be limited to, costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology (which could include higher costs for hardware, including server space).</li>

<ul>
<li>We clarify that the value-added services need to be provided in connection with and supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of production-ready software applications that interact with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. A fee is permitted if it relates to a service that a software developer can elect to purchase from a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer, but is not required to purchase in order to develop and deploy production-ready apps for certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology.</li>
<li>We note that examples used to illustrate when a fee would or would not qualify as a “value-added service,” such as app store listing, are demonstrative, but not required unless otherwise noted in the regulation text.</li>
<li>We permit fees for services associated with the listing and promotion of apps beyond basic application placement so long as the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer ensures that basic access and listing in the app store is provided free of charge (if an application developer depended on such listing to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps for use with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology).</li>
<li>To the degree that a Certified Health IT Developer offers value-added services associated with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology, the Condition of Certification covers its practices related to certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology only. Conversely, this Condition of Certification would not apply to any practices that do not involve certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology.</li>

<li>As discussed in section VIII.C.6.c of the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr>, <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources who locally manage their Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (<abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>®) servers without Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer assistance cannot refuse to provide to Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® service base URL(s) that is/are necessary for patients to use to access their EHI. Equally, pursuant to this Maintenance of Certification requirement, they would be required to publish the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® service base URLs they centrally manage on behalf of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources.</li>
<li>To be open and transparent to the public, developers must provide a hyperlink to the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® Bundle of service base URLs and related organization details to be published with the § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)-certified product on the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL).</li>
<li>Facility level identifiers, for the purposes of certification to these publication requirements, include identifiers such as: a National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, CMS Certification Number (CCN), or other health system ID. Support for one of these identifier types is sufficient, meaning Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are not, for example, required to publish individual NPIs as a floor for certification. Different identifiers may be used depending on the customers a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer has. [see <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1183">89 FR 1288</a>]</li>
<li>Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers have the flexibility to consider using “Organization” and “Endpoint” <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® resources profiles, such as the profiles in the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2.2/brands.html">User-access Brands and Endpoints</a> specification or <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Jan/index.html">Validated Healthcare Directory <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr></a>.

<li>Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers can utilize the "Organization.partOf" data element in the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> "Organization" resource to represent parent/child organization relationships that make up organization hierarchies. A child organization may use the same service base URL (i.e., <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> endpoint) as its parent organization. For the purposes of Certification Program service base URL publication requirements, it is not required that a child "Organization" resource include an "Organization.endpoint" element if its parent "Organization" resource, referenced through the "Organization.partOf" element, already contains the applicable endpoint information in its own "Organization.endpoint" element.</li>
<li>For the time period between when the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> final rule is effective and December 31, 2024, Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers may fulfill their obligations at §<abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(b)(2) by publicly publishing the service base URLs for all customers in a machine-readable format at no charge.

<details class="question">
<summary>Why is this requirement only applicable to Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers with health IT certified to § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) and only for publishing Service Base URLs for patient-facing <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> and not any others, including Bulk Data Access <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>?</summary>
<ul>
<li>The regulatory requirement is a result of both a proposed provision (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7494">84 FR 7494</a>; see also <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7483">84 FR 7483</a>) and the consideration of public comments on the proposal with consideration given the benefits and burden of the requirement and alternative means to achieve <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>'s policy goals (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25764">85 FR 25764-25765</a>).</li>
<li>To facilitate patients’ access to their health information, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> proposed requirements for Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers to publish <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URLs to “…allow health information from [<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>] to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort…including providing access to all data elements of <strong>a patient’s</strong> electronic health record…” (emphasis added) (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7494">84 FR 7494</a>)</li>
<li><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> did not propose that health IT developers publicly publish <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> for multiple patient services in the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Cures Act Proposed Rule. After consideration of public comments and alternative means to achieve <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>’s policy goals, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> did not finalize an expanded requirement to publish all service base URLs.  Below are the additional reasons for this decision: <ul>
<li><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> acknowledged that stakeholders expressed concern about Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers publishing client service base URLs (e.g., obtaining consent from the health care provider).</li>
<li>The <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr> gives <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (e.g., health care organizations) the independent ability to permit <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Users (e.g., third party application developers) to interact with the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Technology deployed by an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170#p-170.404(a)(4)">45 <abbr title="Code of Federal Regulations">CFR</abbr> <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(4)</a>).</li>
<li>In instances where a business associate agreement under the HIPAA regulations is required, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> anticipates that the Service Base URLs targeted for provider-facing applications will be shared with provider-facing application developers (business associates) by the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (covered entities) (see, for example, <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25764">85 FR 25764</a>, “We anticipate that an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source (e.g., a health care organization) that is a HIPAA covered entity would vet and enter into a HIPAA business associate agreement with a provider-facing application developer prior to using the application within their internal technical enterprise”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (e.g., health care providers) and Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers (health IT developers of certified health IT) may implicate the information blocking regulations if they did not make available Service Base URLs (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25765">85 FR 25765</a>.) Specifically, we stated in the <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr> that “…A <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URL cannot be withheld by an actor [health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, and HINs/HIEs] as it (just like many other technical interfaces) is necessary to enable the access, exchange, and use of EHI.” (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25813">85 FR 25813</a>).</li>
