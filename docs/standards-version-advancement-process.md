**Health IT developers are permitted to test and certify using newer versions of implementation guides that have been approved by the ONC National Coordinator.**

ONC has established the voluntary Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP) to enable health IT developers to incorporate newer versions of approved standards and implementation specifications, as part of the Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (§ 170.405) of the 21st Century Cures Act. 

Using SVAP, Certified Health IT Developers are permitted to voluntarily use a more advanced version of the standard(s) and implementation specification(s) approved by the National Coordinator, than is adopted in the ONC 2015 Edition Certification Criteria. Currently, this flexibility is limited to standards and implementation specifications that are adopted in the certification criteria required to meet the Real World Testing Condition of Certification, which include § 170.315(b), (c)(1) through (c)(3), (e)(1), (f), (g)(7) through (g)(10), and (h). Health IT developers must ensure that they address standards adopted under SVAP in their Real World Testing plans and results submitted to Authorized Certification Bodies.
