## Background on API certification & API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements

### *ONC Cures Act Final Rule and Interim Final Rule - (g)(10) & API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification*

The <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text">21st Century Cures Act (Section 4002)</a> and subsequent <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/">ONC Cures Act Final Rule</a> established a condition of certification requirement in the ONC Health IT Certification Program which requires applicable health IT developers participating in the program to develop and deploy a standardized API:

>“health information from such technology [is] to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.”

This requirement also states that a health IT developer must, through an API:

>“provide access to all data elements of a patient's electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws.”

ONC finalized a certification criterion for APIs for single and multiple patient services at § 170.315(g)(10) to replace the certification criterion at § 170.315(g)(8). Additionally, ONC finalized API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements at § 170.404 that apply to health IT developers certified to criteria § 170.315(g)(7), § 170.315(g)(8), § 170.315(g)(9), and § 170.315(g)(10).
