## Paragraph (a)(3)(iv): API Fees - Permitted Fee (Value-Added Services)
### July 2021
**Stakeholder Inquiry**: If an EHR developer’s API includes both certified and non-certified capabilities, does the entire API fall within the requirements of § 170.404?

- Can an API be certified if it also contains non-certified capabilities so long as it also meets the certification criteria?  
- Can the EHR developer charge for value-added services through an “app store” for the non-certified portion of such APIs?

**ONC Response**: The fees conditions at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170/subpart-D#p-170.404(a)(3)">Applies to Entire Criterion</a> all relate to fees administered by Certified API Developers for certified API technology. According to <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170/subpart-D#p-170.404(c)">45 CFR 170.404(c)</a>, certified API technology “means the capabilities of Health IT Modules that are certified to any of the API-focused certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) through (10).” The certification criteria in the ONC Health IT Certification Program include the minimum technical requirements Health IT Modules must support; health IT developers are not prohibited from exceeding the certification requirements included in the API-focused certification criteria at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (10).

According to <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170/subpart-D#p-170.404(a)(3)(iv)">45 CFR 170.404(a)(3)(iv)</a>, “A Certified API Developer is permitted to charge fees to an API User for value-added services related to certified API technology, so long as such services are not necessary to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready software that interacts with certified API technology.” 
Additionally, we clarified in the 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program Final Rule (ONC Cures Act Final Rule) that “To the degree that a health IT developer administers an “app store” and offers value-added services associated with certified API technology, the Condition of Certification covers its practices related to certified API technology only. Conversely, this Condition of Certification would not apply to any practices that do not involve certified API technology. However, health IT developers would need to be mindful of any applicable information blocking rules that may apply to their app store practices given applicable facts and circumstances” (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1365">85 FR 25760</a>).

If a Certified Health IT Developer does not abide by applicable Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, the nonconformities can be addressed through the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certified-health-it-complaint-process">Certified Health IT Complaint Process</a>. 

While we read and responded to this question as being specifically about the fees conditions at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170/subpart-D#p-170.404(a)(3)">45 CFR 170.404</a>, for fees administered by Certified API Developers for certified API technology, we note in closing that health IT developers need to remain mindful that practices that do not violate 45 CFR 170.404 could still implicate the information blocking definition (45 CFR 171,103). For example, a practice that does not involve certified API technology would not be directly addressed by 45 CFR 170.404 but could implicate the information blocking regulations. To be certain their fees or other business practices will not be considered information blocking as defined in 45 CFR 171.103, the developer can choose to conform their practices to the conditions of relevant information blocking exception(s) such as the Fees Exception (45 CFR 171.302) and Licensing Exception (45 CFR 171.303).

We are not able to provide individualized advice on whether a specific fact pattern would or would not satisfy an exception or constitute information blocking.

Anyone who believes they may have experienced or observed information blocking by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/cures/sites/default/files/cures/2020-03/InformationBlockingActors.pdf">any health care provider, health IT developer of Certified Health IT, or health information network or health information exchange</a> is encouraged to share their concerns with us through the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://healthit.gov/report-info-blocking">Information Blocking Portal</a> on ONC’s website, HealthIT.gov.
