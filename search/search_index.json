After consideration of public comments and alternative means to achieve ONC\u2019s policy goals, ONC did not finalize an expanded requirement to publish all service base URLs.  Below are the additional reasons for this decision: <ul> <li>ONC acknowledged that stakeholders expressed concern about Certified API Developers publishing client service base URLs (e.g., obtaining consent from the health care provider).</li> <li>The ONC Cures Act Final Rule gives API Information Sources (e.g., health care organizations) the independent ability to permit API Users (e.g., third party application developers) to interact with the certified API Technology deployed by an API Information Source (45 CFR 170.404(a)(4)).</li> <li>In instances where a business associate agreement under the HIPAA regulations is required, ONC anticipates that the Service Base URLs targeted for provider-facing applications will be shared with provider-facing application developers (business associates) by the API Information Sources (covered entities) (see, for example, 85 FR 25764, \u201cWe anticipate that an API Information Source (e.g., a health care organization) that is a HIPAA covered entity would vet and enter into a HIPAA business associate agreement with a provider-facing application developer prior to using the application within their internal technical enterprise\u201d).</li> </ul> </li> <li>API Information Sources (e.g., health care providers) and Certified API Developers (health IT developers of certified health IT) may implicate the information blocking regulations if they did not make available Service Base URLs (85 FR 25765.) Specifically, we stated in the Cures Act Final Rule that \u201c\u2026A FHIR service base URL cannot be withheld by an actor [health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, and HINs/HIEs] as it (just like many other technical interfaces) is necessary to enable the access, exchange, and use of EHI.\u201d (85 FR 25813).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"404-conditions-maintenance/#rollout-of-g10-certified-apis","title":"Rollout of (g)(10)-Certified APIs","text":"Regulation text at \u00a7\u2009170.404(B)(3) <p>(3) Rollout of (g)(10)-certified APIs.

By December 31, 2024, publication of these service base URLs and organization details must conform to the format detailed in the paragraphs under \u00a7 170.404(b)(2), including publication of service base URLs and organization details in a FHIR\u00ae format and collected into a Bundle FHIR resource. For the time period between when the HTI-1 Final Rule is effective (March 11, 2024) and December 31, 2024, Certified API Developers may fulfill their obligations at \u00a7170.404(b)(2) by publicly publishing a link to the service base URLs for all their customers in a machine-readable format at no charge (89 FR 1287).</p> <p>We encourage Certified API Developers to consider options beyond the minimum requirements when possible, and to publish organization details in a way that best supports API Users (e.g., third party application developers) in presenting details that patients can easily recognize and connect to.</p> <p>To clarify how the service base URL requirements at \u00a7170.404(b)(2) apply when Certified API Developers choose to represent parent/child organization relationships, we provide the following \u00a7 170.404 clarification that we'll also publish in the \u00a7 170.404 Certification Companion Guide (CCG):</p> <p>Certified API Developers can utilize the \"Organization.partOf\" data element in the FHIR \"Organization\" resource to represent parent/child organization relationships that make up organization hierarchies. A child organization may use the same service base URL (i.e., FHIR endpoint) as its parent organization. For the purposes of Certification Program service base URL publication requirements, it is not required that a child \"Organization\" resource include an \"Organization.endpoint\" element if its parent \"Organization\" resource, referenced through the \"Organization.partOf\" element, already contains the applicable endpoint information in its own \"Organization.endpoint\" element.</p> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: Regarding the updated service base URL publication requirements adopted with HTI-1, we are seeking further clarification on the granularity that is expected for publishing \u201cfacility or organization level identifiers\u201d as referred to in the final rule preamble (https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1183).</p> <p>We understand through the above referenced clarification that there is not a need or expectation to publish endpoints at an individual provider level, but are still a bit unclear on the level of granularity expected for a \u201cfacility or organization\u201d level. For example, this could theoretically be interpreted as either an integrated delivery network (IDN) organizational level which would likely consist of many different individual hospitals and other facilities, or as an individual physical facility (e.g., hospital or clinic) level.</p> <p>Is there a more specific definition for this that ONC can provide to guide developers, or is this determination left up to the developer provided that all endpoints serviced by the developer that are used for patient access purposes are published?</p> <p>ASTP Response: The Maintenance of Certification requirements for service base URL publication at 45 CFR 170.404(b)(2) require that, at a minimum, the service base URLs and related organization details are published at the Certified API Developer customer level.</p> <p>If, for example, a Certified API Developer licenses their \u00a7 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Module to an integrated delivery network (IDN) that deploys that module across many different individual facilities, it would be minimally expected that the IDN's name, location and a related facility identifier be published alongside the patient access service base URLs(s) for this customer to meet the publication requirements at \u00a7 170.404(b)(2).</p> <p>Similarly if, for example, a Certified API Developer licenses their \u00a7 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Module to an individual provider who deploys that module across their practice, it would be minimally expected that the provider's practice name, location and a related facility identifier for that practice be published alongside the patient access service base URLs(s) for this customer to meet the publication requirements at  \u00a7 170.404(b)(2).</p> <p>More information on the \u00a7 170.404(b)(2) requirements can be found in the Application Programming Interfaces Certification Companion Guide and the API Resource Guide.</p> <p>We encourage Certified API Developers to consider options beyond the minimum requirements when possible, and to publish organization details at a level of granularity that best supports API Users (e.g., third party application developers) in presenting details that patients can easily recognize and connect to. As an example in the case of a large IDN with many different individual hospitals and facilities that a patient might visit, Certified API Developers can consider leveraging additional Organization resource features in the FHIR\u00ae specification like the <code>Organization.partOf</code> element in the FHIR Organization resource to represent the different IDN sub-organizations to provide more granular information.</p> <p>Finally, we also encourage Certified API Developers to considering following related FHIR community work in the endpoint discovery space, such as the recently published User-access Brands and Endpoints FHIR specification which provides guidance for ensuring \"a consistent and recognizable user experience when connecting users to health records across various platforms and services.\"</p> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: Regarding your Service Base URL Publication requirements:</p> <ul> <li>What are the options for a provider practice level identifier? </li> <li>The ONC references a facility identifier. Typically, each hospital has its own CMS Certification Number (CCN). The ONC mentions a health system ID number. What is that number?</li> </ul> <p>ASTP Response: ONC does not specify a particular facility, provider, or health system identifier that is required to meet our updated Service Base URL publication requirements at 45 CFR 170.404(b)(2) finalized in the HTI-1 rule. Certified API Developers have flexibility to choose any facility level identifier for each of the organizations (i.e., API Information Sources) deploying their 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules.</p> <p>To your first question, if you choose to meet a facility level identifier requirement by publishing a collection of individual provider identifiers for a particular API Information Source, a widely used provider level identifier is the National Provider Identifier (NPI). To support interoperability, we encourage Certified API Developers choosing to publish individual provider identifiers to use the most relevant and widely usable individual identifiers such as NPIs. Another example of a provider level identifier would be a provider's state license number.</p> <p>To your second question, our mention of \"health system ID\" number is meant to be a generic reference. A CMS Certification Number (CCN) counts as a health system or API Information Source facility identifier to meet our requirement at 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B). Another example of a health system or API Information Source facility identifier would be an organization level NPI.</p> <p>As we indicated in HTI-1 at 89 FR 1288, \"[f]acility level identifiers, for the purposes of certification to our Endpoint publication requirements, include identifiers such as: a National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, CMS Certification Number (CCN), or other health system ID. Support for one of these identifier types is sufficient, meaning Certified API Developers are not required to publish individual NPIs as a floor for certification. Different identifiers may be used depending on the customers a Certified API Developer has.\" ONC does not specifically define \"other health system ID\" but instead provides flexibility to developers as to which identifier is used.</p>"},{"location":"inquiry-portal/404-inquiries/#2023-inquiries_1","title":"2023 Inquiries","text":"<p>Stakeholder Inquiry: I have questions about the regulatory text in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule found here: https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1405.</p> <p>Should this list be published on CHPL?

We require a Health IT Module to support a patient\u2019s ability to provide authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level.</p> <p>Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on individual FHIR resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping scopes under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on individual resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes is available, if requested by the patient.</p> <p>As part of supporting the SMART App Launch \u201cpermission-v2\u201d capability for the purposes of certification, if an app requests authorization for a resource level scope for the \u201cCondition\u201d or \u201cObservation\u201d resources, then for patient authorization purposes a Health IT Module must support presentation of the required sub-resource scopes to the patient for authorization. Specifically, sub-resource scopes must be presented for patient authorization as follows:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cCondition\u201d sub-resource scopes \u201cEncounter Diagnosis\u201d, \u201cProblem List\u201d, and \u201cHealth Concern\u201d if a \u201cCondition\u201d resource level scope is requested </li> <li>\u201cObservation\u201d sub-resource scopes \u201cClinical Test\u201d, \u201cLaboratory\u201d, \u201cSocial History\u201d, \u201cSDOH\u201d, \u201cSurvey\u201d, and \u201cVital Signs\u201d if an \u201cObservation\u201d resource level scope is requested </li> </ul> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: In the context of HTI-1 Final Rule (g)(10) criterion requirements for SMART v2 granular scopes:</p> <p>Question 1: In a scenario where an app requests access to retrieve data for the full Condition or Observation resource (i.e., not utilizing a more granular sub-resource scope), is it acceptable for developers to only allow patients ability to approve or deny access at that full FHIR resource level. Or, is there an expectation to still provide the ability to approve or deny for the more granular individual sub-resources or a grouped set of sub-resources?</p> <p>Question 2: The second question relates to supporting the granular scopes control for clinician launch scenarios. Are Health IT Modules required to support presenting scopes in an authorization UI to users for the clinician access for EHR launch SMART capability workflow? Instead, is the option available to provide authorization during the clinician access for EHR launch workflow using granular scopes coordinated during the app registration process?</p> <p>ASTP Response: To respond to the first question: For the purposes of certification to the \u00a7\u2009170.315(g)(10) criterion, a Health IT Module must support patient authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level for the sub-resource scopes specified in the HTI-1 Final Rule. Given an app requests a resource level scope for which sub-resource scopes must be supported, the Health IT Module must support a patient\u2019s ability to provide authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level for the sub-resource scopes under that resource level scope. For example, given a \u201cCondition\u201d resource level scope is requested by an app, the Health IT Module must support patient authorization of individual \u201cEncounter Diagnosis\u201d, \u201cProblem List\u201d, and \u201cHealth Concern\u201d sub-resource scopes.</p> <p>To respond to the second question: For purposes of certification to the \u00a7\u2009170.315(g)(10) criterion, a Health IT Module is not required to support for authorization purposes presentation of sub-resource scopes to the user during clinician access for EHR launch.</p> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: We have three questions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the HTI-1 final rule preamble there is discussion clarifying that support for wildcard scopes is not mandatory. However, it is referenced in context of the permission-patient capability, which caused some confusion. Permission-patient, as we understand it, is simply the ability to authorize a user to access to a single patient\u2019s record instead of all the patients the user in context has access to (which is what permission-user capability is). So, it is not necessarily specific to a patient access scenario but could be applicable for both patient and clinician access scenarios as evidenced by inclusion in all four capability sets defined at 8.1.1 in the SMART v2 IG.  Our assumption is that the intent was actually to clarify that wildcard scopes do not have to be supported for any patient access scenario, whereas they would need to be supported for clinician access scenarios. Is this a correct understanding of the intent?</p> </li> <li> <p>The SMART v2 specification was adopted as standard at 170.215(c)(2) specifically citing several optional capabilities, including all \u201cCapabilities\u201d as defined in \u201c8.1.2 Capabilities,\u201d excepting the \u201cpermission-online\u201d capability. What is unclear from this is whether all of those capabilities are required to be supported for every persona, or if they are limited to specific relevant ones based on the capability sets defined at 8.1.1.</p> <ul> <li>For example, the context-standalone-patient capability is included as a requirement at 8.1.2 but it is exclusively included in the Patient Access for Standalone Apps capability set at 8.1.1.1. Does the 8.1.2 capabilities requirement compel developers to support context-standalone-patient for both clinician and patient persona launches, or only patient since the equivalent Clinician Access for Standalone capability set at 8.1.1.3 does not include it (even though that capability set is not even required as adopted)?</li> <li>Similarly, context-ehr-patient and context-ehr-encounter are required as part of the 8.1.2 capabilities, but they are only included in the Clinician Access for EHR Launch capability set at 8.1.1.4 with context-ehr-patient alone included in the Patient Access for EHR Launch (i.e. from Portal) capability set at 8.1.1.2. If either/both of these were required for the patient persona this would indicate that developers must support Patient Access for EHR Launch (i.e. from Portal) even though this capability set was specifically excluded from the requirements (i.e., only \u201cPatient Access for Standalone Apps\u201d and \u201cClinician Access for EHR Launch\u201d capability sets are cited in the standard adopted at 170.215(c)(2)).</li> <li>For one more example, context-standalone-encounter is required as part of the 8.1.2 capabilities but is not included in any capability sets defined at 8.1.1. It\u2019s unclear whether this would need to be supported for both (or either) personas.</li> <li>Overall, it seems that the way the SMART v2 requirements were adopted citing certain capability sets at 8.1.1 and then citing all capabilities at 8.1.2 is conflicting. We would recommend ONC consider clarifying that only the 8.1.2 capabilities aligned with the relevant required capability sets are truly required for developers to support.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We\u2019re hoping for some clarification on the HTI-1 requirement for support of \u201c3.0.2.3 Finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters\u201d as part of the SMART v2 standard. The preamble specifically identifies that this requirement was adopted as proposed, which was to require support for more granular resource constraints specifically for \u201cthe \u201ccategory\u201d parameter for (1) the Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern and (2) the Observation resource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs.\u201d The sub-resources identified for the Condition resource are accurate but we believe there may be an issue with those identified for the Observation resource. From reviewing the latest FHIR US Core 6.1.0 IG it appears that the Clinical Test and SDOH options are no longer valid. Accordingly, it would seem that there is a need to instead point to the Observation Category value set as the scope of categories that must be supported as sub-resources.</p> </li> </ol> <p>ASTP Response:</p> <ol> <li> <p>For \u00a7\u2009170.315(g)(10) criterion requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) regarding authorization for patient and user scopes, we clarify wildcard scopes as defined in the implementation specifications at \u00a7\u2009170.215(c) are not required to be supported.</p> </li> <li> <p>We clarify the following SMART App Launch v2.0.0 capabilities must be supported as part of fulfilling the authentication and authorization requirements at \u00a7\u2009170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) when certifying using the implementation specification at \u00a7\u2009170.215(c)(2):</p> <ul> <li> <p>To support patient access for standalone apps, the Health IT Module must support:</p> <ul> <li>the capabilities of \"launch-standalone\" and \"context-standalone-patient\"; and</li> <li>the capabilities in subsections \"Authorization Methods\", \"Client Types\", \"Single Sign-on\", and \"Permissions\" except the \"permission-online\" and \"permission-user\" capabilities</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>To support clinician access for EHR launch, the Health IT Module must support:</p> <ul> <li>the capabilities of \"launch-ehr\", \"context-banner\", \"context-style\", \"context-ehr-patient\", and \"context-ehr-encounter\" (if supporting USCDI v2 or v3); and</li> <li>the capabilities in subsections \"Authorization Methods\", \"Client Types\", \"Single Sign-on\", and \"Permissions\" except the \"permission-online\" capability</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>As finalized in the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1294), Health IT Modules are required to support SMART App Launch v2.0.0 \"Finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters\" for the \u201ccategory\u201d parameter for the Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern, and the Observation resource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs.

Systems may return other resource types if they believe them to be relevant, and tests now provide informational messages in this case.</p> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: Does ONC have a published list of IP addresses we can whitelist for the (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit hosted at https://inferno.healthit.gov/onc-certification-g10-test-kit?</p> <p>ASTP Response: The IP addresses for ONC's hosted instance of Inferno are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The latest Inferno release (inferno.healthit.gov): 52.20.119.0</li> <li>The development build of Inferno (inferno-dev.healthit.gov): 34.225.213.213</li> </ul> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: Do we need to register Inferno as EHR Practitioner App to test ONC certification criteria or we can use SMART Apps like Cardiac Risk to test the criteria? If it\u2019s the Inferno that we need to register for EHR Practitioner App criteria testing, can you please guide me on the workflow on which the EHR practitioner app criteria works for testing in Inferno tool?</p> <p>ASTP Response: Response to Question 1: Do we need to register Inferno as EHR Practitioner App to test the specific criteria or we can use SMART APPS like Cardiac Risk to test the criteria?</p> <p>Only ONC-approved test methods can be used to test products intended for certification in the Certification Program. Currently, Inferno is the only ONC-approved testing tool for testing compliance to the \u00a7 170.315(g)(10) \"Standardized API for patient and population services\" certification criterion. When using Inferno to test compliance to the \u00a7 170.315(g)(10) criterion, Inferno must be registered with the Health IT Module so that the \"EHR Practitioner App\" tests in Inferno can be completed.</p> <p>Response to Question 2: If it\u2019s the Inferno that we need to register for EHR Practitioner App criteria testing, can you please guide me on the workflow on which the EHR practitioner app criteria works for testing in Inferno tool?</p> <p>The \"EHR Practitioner App\" tests in Inferno require the Health IT Module demonstrate the ability to perform an EHR launch to a SMART on FHIR confidential client with patient context, refresh token, and OpenID Connect identity token. After launch, Inferno performs a simple Patient resource read on the patient in context. Inferno then refreshes the access token and reads the Patient resource using the new access token to ensure that the refresh was successful. Finally, Inferno decodes and validates the authentication information provided by OpenID Connect.</p> <p>Additional detail regarding the \"EHR Practitioner App\" tests in Inferno is available in the ONC Certification (g)(10) Matrix provided with each Inferno release. The ONC Certification (g)(10) Matrix for the current version of Inferno is available via the onc-certification-g10-test-kit repository on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"inquiry-portal/g10-inquiries/#2021-inquiries_7","title":"2021 Inquiries","text":"<p>Stakeholder Inquiry: What are the test data requirements for testing to (g)(10) using Inferno?</p> <p>ASTP Response: The Inferno (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit does not currently require a specific set of data to be entered into the system under test prior to testing. Instead, it leverages HL7 FHIR's built-in conformance rules to ensure that data returned is valid, conforms to required profiles, and contains all elements that must be supported. This allows systems to use either their own sample data or supplied sample data.</p> <p>If needed, Inferno supplies multiple synthetic data sets suitable for testing. These data sets are ideal for testing because they provide coverage of all HL7 US Core IG profiles and support for all \"Must Support\" data elements without requiring a large set of patients or sacrificing realism. These synthetic data can be generated using the uscore-data-script on GitHub.</p> <p>Otherwise, a health IT developer can supply their own sample data loaded into the system under test for certification, but the sample data must be able to demonstrate all the conformance requirements for certification according to the Test Procedure for 170.315(g)(10). We also encourage health IT developers read the clarifications provided on the Certification Companion Guide for 170.315(g)(10).</p> <p>Stakeholder Inquiry: Can Inferno be used for Provider Directory testing? We have been able to use this tool for Patient Access API testing.</p> <p>ASTP Response: The Inferno (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit is designed to support the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services certification criterion (\u00a7 170.315(g)(10)) for the ONC Health IT Certification Program. Since a provider directory is not part of the \u00a7 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion, the Inferno (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit does not support provider directory testing.</p> <p>However, the Inferno FHIR Validator tool can be used to validate FHIR resources against implementation guides, including provider directory FHIR implementation guides, like the HL7 FHIR\u00ae Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU 1. Additionally, Inferno is currently being updated to allow for greater extensibility and testing capabilities with a broad array of implementation guides. Support for fully-featured provider directory implementation guide testing may also be added in the future.</p>"}]}
