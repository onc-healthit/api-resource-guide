A child organization may use the same service base URL (i.e., <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> endpoint) as its parent organization. For the purposes of Certification Program service base URL publication requirements, it is not required that a child "Organization" resource include an "Organization.endpoint" element if its parent "Organization" resource, referenced through the "Organization.partOf" element, already contains the applicable endpoint information in its own "Organization.endpoint" element.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Regarding the updated service base URL publication requirements adopted with <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr>, we are seeking further clarification on the granularity that is expected for publishing โfacility or organization level identifiersโ as referred to in the final rule preamble (https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1183).</p>
<p>We understand through the above referenced clarification that there is not a need or expectation to publish endpoints at an individual provider level, but are still a bit unclear on the level of granularity expected for a โfacility or organizationโ level. For example, this could theoretically be interpreted as either an integrated delivery network (IDN) organizational level which would likely consist of many different individual hospitals and other facilities, or as an individual physical facility (e.g., hospital or clinic) level.</p>
<p>Is there a more specific definition for this that <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> can provide to guide developers, or is this determination left up to the developer provided that all endpoints serviced by the developer that are used for patient access purposes are published?</p>

<p>We encourage Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers to consider options beyond the minimum requirements when possible, and to publish organization details at a level of granularity that best supports <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-170/section-170.404#p-170.404(c)(API%20User)"><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Users</a> (e.g., third party application developers) in presenting details that patients can easily recognize and connect to.

Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers have flexibility to choose any facility level identifier for each of the organizations (i.e., <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-170#p-170.404(c)(API%20Information%20Source)"><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources</a>) deploying their 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)-certified Health IT Modules.</p>
<p>To your first question, if you choose to meet a facility level identifier requirement by publishing a collection of individual provider identifiers for a particular <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source, a widely used provider level identifier is the National Provider Identifier (NPI). To support interoperability, we encourage Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers choosing to publish individual provider identifiers to use the most relevant and widely usable individual identifiers such as NPIs. Another example of a provider level identifier would be a provider's state license number.</p>
<p>To your second question, our mention of "health system ID" number is meant to be a generic reference. A CMS Certification Number (CCN) counts as a health system or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source facility identifier to meet our requirement at <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to ยง 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(b)(2)(ii)(B). Another example of a health system or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source facility identifier would be an organization level NPI.</p>
<p>As we indicated in <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1183">89 FR 1288</a>, "[f]acility level identifiers, for the purposes of certification to our Endpoint publication requirements, include identifiers such as: a National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, CMS Certification Number (CCN), or other health system ID. Support for one of these identifier types is sufficient, meaning Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are not required to publish individual NPIs as a floor for certification. Different identifiers may be used depending on the customers a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer has." <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> does not specifically define "other health system ID" but instead provides flexibility to developers as to which identifier is used.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: I have questions about the regulatory text in the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr> found here: <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1405">https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1405</a>.</p>
<p>Should this list be published on CHPL? We see the "place" for the information on CHPL, but we are seeing that many EHRs have very little to no information published and most don't have their customer list. Is this a violation of the requirements? Are there any exceptions to publishing this information?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Thank you for your inquiry. In order to interact with a <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> RESTful <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, an app needs to know the โ<abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URL,โ which is often referred to colloquially as a โ<abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> server's endpoint.โโThe public availability and easy accessibility of this information is a central necessity to assuring the use of <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>-based <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> without special effort for patient access apps.

The Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer must publicly publish the service base URLs for all of its customers regardless of whether the Health IT Modules certified to ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) are centrally managed by the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer or locally deployed by an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source, and in a machine-readable format at no charge.</p>
<p>For a Health IT Module certified to ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>), a hyperlink to the list of service base URLs is published with the product information on the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL).

<p>To be open and transparent to the public, developers must provide a hyperlink to the list of service base URLs to be published with the product on the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are encouraged to use a standardized format when publishing the service base URLs for all of its customers. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> recommends Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers leverage the <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> 4.0.1 โEndpointโ resource, or profiles of this resource such as the Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU1 โ<a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Jan/StructureDefinition-vhdir-endpoint.html">vhdir-endpoint</a>โ profile, to represent service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their health information. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> also encourages developers to provide as much information about the service base URLs as available, including the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sourceโs organization details, such as name, location, and provider identifiers (e.g., NPI, CCN, or health system ID). These steps will help industry coalesce around standards that enable application developers to more easily and consistently provide patients access to their electronic health information.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions to the requirement that Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers must publish service base URLs for all Health IT Modules certified to ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) that can be used by patients to access their EHI.</p>
