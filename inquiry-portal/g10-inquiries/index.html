<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Is Pregnancy Intent required?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: For certification to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" criterion using <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> v3 / <a target="_blank" href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/">US Core v6.1</a> or <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> v4 / <a target="_blank" href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU7/index.html">US Core v7</a>, support for the "US Core Observation Pregnancy Intent" profile is required to be supported.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: What is the expectation for the use of the new US Core QuestionnaireResponse Profile, given that there are no Inferno tests for it, and how and where should it be included in the documents?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: For purposes of certification to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" criterion, health IT developers are not required to demonstrate Health IT Module support for the โQuestionnaireResponseโ US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> profile. However, if the Health IT Module optionally supports group export of "QuestionnaireResponse" resources then those exported "QuestionnaireResponse" resources will be checked for conformance to the โQuestionnaireResponseโ US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> profile as part of the conformance tests for the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(i)(B) requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: How can we address the requirement to support and populate the abatementDateTime field for Condition Encounter Diagnoses, given that our current products do not allow encounter diagnoses to be marked as resolved or in remission?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Generally for the purposes of certification to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, <abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> requires conformance to โshallโ and โmust supportโ requirements from referenced standards and implementation specifications such as US Core v6.1. This includes conformance to "must support" requirements for the "US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile".</p>
<p>However, if there are concerns regarding the appropriateness of US Core requirements, such as ambiguity or incompatibility with real world implementation, we suggest submitting a 'patch' ticket with the <a target="_blank" href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+%27Patch%27+Process"><abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> Cross Group Projects Work Group US Core 'Patch' Process</a>. The processing and resolution of such a ticket may provide additional information for us to consider regarding this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Could you clarify the requirements for supporting sub-resource-level scopes in the context of <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> and HTI-2?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: For the purposes of certification to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, a Health IT Module must support the capability to present sub-resource scopes to the patient for authorization as clarified in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services">ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Certification Companion Guide</a>. This includes support for patient authorization of certain scopes at the sub-resource level even if the authorization request from the app is made at the resource level.</p>
<p>However, while the aforementioned capability must be supported for the purposes of certification, a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer may adapt their certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology deployment in production to suit the particular needs, circumstances, and workflows of their customers. This could include revisions to the patient authorization workflow to accommodate customer needs, assuming such revisions are compliant with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/conditions-maintenance-certification">Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Are we required to allow connected 3rd party Provider facing apps the ability to have write capabilities, for example enabling the provider app to โwriteโ new data back to an EHR?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services certification criterion requires Health IT Modules to support <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>-enabled โreadโ services for single and multiple patients. โReadโ services include those that allow authenticated and authorized third-party applications to view EHI through a secure <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. These services specifically exclude โwriteโ capabilities, where authenticated and authorized third-party applications would be able to create or modify EHI through a secure <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1210">85 FR 25743</a>)</p>
<h3 id="2024-inquiries">2024 Inquiries<a class="headerlink" href="#2024-inquiries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: I have a question regarding the storage of patient information for certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>, specifically how long a certified health IT module must store information for a former customer. If a customer (letโs say a hospital facility) chooses to go to another EHR company how long must we store information associated with that hospital facility in order to make that data available via (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Through the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Health IT Certification Program (Program), <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> implements required standards and functionalities that must be supported by certified products. In general, the Program requires the electronic standards in which available data is stored and/or shared by certified health IT but not how much data or when specific data must be recorded or shared.</p>
<p>Furthermore, neither the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion nor the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements specify a requirement for the storage duration of data of former customers.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Is it permitted for Certified Health IT to limit access to certain <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource endpoints depending on the authentication method? We are integrating with a Certified Health IT <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> implementation and have noticed that for patient/provider login apps, they allow access to all <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource endpoints. However, when we try to authenticate as a backend service using our own app credentials, they only allow access to Patient and Encounter. Is this allowed according to the certification?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: A Health IT Module certified to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion must support the capabilities described in the data response requirements at ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(i), including:</p>

We were wondering if you can provide answers or linked resources to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>My understanding of the 21st Century Cures Act, as it pertains to data interoperability via <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>, is that it requires Health Insurance Plans (and other health related orgs) to have <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> by end of year 2023.  Is this correct?</li>
<li>Does this pertain only to Medicare or Medicaid patient data?</li>
<li>Is this required to be "certified" by the Federal Government?</li>
<li>What is that certification?</li>
<li>Can Health Insurance plans or other health organizations operate without that certification?</li>
<li>If so, for how long?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Can you confirm that the requirements of the 2015 Edition Cures Update Base EHR Definition (specifically the requirement to satisfy 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)) can be met using one Certified Health IT Module or a combination of Certified Health IT Modules?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: You are correct that the requirements of the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/2015-edition-test-method/2015-edition-cures-update-base-electronic-health-record-definition">2015 Edition Cures Update Base EHR Definition</a> can be met using one Certified Health IT Module or a combination of Certified Health IT Modules.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Are there any (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) requirements around patient data retention?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Neither the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion nor the ยง 170.315 (b)(10) "Electronic Health Information export" criterion have any data retention requirement. However, most states have laws and regulations governing the retention of patient medical records. As such, historical data should be maintained by the organization in accordance with all applicable state laws, and once those requirements have been met, managing historical data in a consistent manner as business needs dictate. Organizations must follow all HIPAA requirements for the destruction of protected health information. And, in addition, they should review the Office of Civil Rights guidance on data destruction to ensure their policies and practices align to it.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: If a Health IT Developer is providing a <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Server and <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient access, but not the authorization server (e.g. OAuth 2 + OIDC) or the App registration portal, can such a solution be certified? Some organizations already have an authorization server, so providing the Patient Access <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> involves integrating the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> with the existing authorization server. It seems from a (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) perspective that demonstration or live testing must include authorization, authentication, etc. As such is it accurate to assume that each fully integrated solution comprised of multiple vendor components needs to be certified, but that some of the individual components such as a <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> + <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Server cannot be certified alone?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Health IT developers are permitted to use โ<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/relieduponsoftwareguidance.pdf">relied upon software</a>โ to demonstrate compliance with certification criteria in <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>'s Health IT Certification Program. Relied upon software is typically 3rd party software that is not developed by the health IT developer presenting its health IT for testing and certification. Relied upon software may be used to demonstrate compliance with a portion of an adopted certification criterion or an entire certification criterion.</p>
<p>A developer must present its own health IT for certification, and  may also use other software (โrelied upon softwareโ) to meet certification requirements. When a health IT developer relies upon software to demonstrate compliance with a certification criterion, such relied upon software must be included in the scope of the certification issued to the Health IT Module.</p>
<p>In the provided example, the health IT developer could use "relied upon software" in the form of an authorization server to fulfill authentication and authorization requirements in the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" criterion. However, a Health IT Module cannot be certified to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" criterion without fulfilling all of its specified requirements, including authentication and authorization requirements.

<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Health IT developers certified to the criterion at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170/subpart-C#p-170.315(g)(10)">45 <abbr title="Code of Federal Regulations">CFR</abbr> 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)</a> are required to support standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> access to electronic health information according to the adopted standards and implementation specifications referenced in the criterion for all applicable information (e.g. <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> and US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> โmandatoryโ and โmust supportโ data elements) that have been incorporated into certified EHR technology. For example, some health organizations may choose to incorporate only a portion of a <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> CDA document received from an external setting into their clinical record; (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)-certified Health IT Modules would need to support access to the portion of incorporated information via a standardized <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>-based <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.

<ol>
<li>The Inferno (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit test 4.31.01 requires a system under test to demonstrate support for the Discharge Summary note type (18842-5). Are ambulatory vendors expected to demonstrate support for this note type for the purposes of (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) certification?</li>
<li>For the purposes of certification, what are the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> search requirements around <code>DocumentReference</code> note types?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Answers to question #1 and #2 respectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion requires the Health IT Module respond to requests for single and multiple patient's data according to the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> standard and the US Core implementation guide. Using the base regulatory standards for reference, the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> v1 standard requires support for the "<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/isa/taxonomy/term/606/uscdi-v1">Discharge Summary Note</a>" data element and its corresponding LOINC code. Similarly, the US Core 3.1.1 implementation guide section <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/clinical-notes-guidance.html#clinical-notes">2.2.1 Clinical Notes Guidance</a> requires support for the Discharge Summary clinical note and its corresponding LOINC code. Therefore, the Inferno testing tool tests for support for the Discharge Summary clinical note and its corresponding LOINC code.</li>
<li>To certify to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, a Health IT Module must respond to requests and searches for single and multiple patient's data according to the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> standard and the US Core implementation guide. This includes support for the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> Clinical Notes data class and the corresponding SHALL and Must Support requirements in the US Core clinical notes guidance and <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> profiles (e.g., DocumentReference). The US Core 3.1.1 implementation guide includes a shall requirement in the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> profile to "support searching using the combination of the patient and type search parameters" and specifies "The DocumentReference.type binding must support at a minimum the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/ValueSet-us-core-clinical-note-type.html">5 Common Clinical Notes</a> and may extend to the full US Core DocumentReference Type Value Set". Thus, while the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/ValueSet-us-core-clinical-note-type.html"><abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> 4.0.1</a> specification provides flexibility to the server to determine which resources meet the search parameter criteria and provide additional search results if they are deemed relevant, the server should provide meaningful search results for searches regarding the 5 Common Clinical note types specified in the US Core implantation guide. Also, while the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion does not specify how patient data storage must be implemented, patient data should be stored in such a manner that permits the Health IT Module's single patient <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> to return relevant search results to <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> searches.

The Bulk Data Access 1.0.1 implementation guide provides flexibility to the server in implementing how these URLs eventually provide access to the bulk data files. Given this flexibility, Health IT Modules may require clients to re-direct to a capability URL without an authorization header when resolving the file URLs provided in the manifest. To address this flexibility, the Inferno testing tool was updated in the April release (4/11/2022).</p>
<p>Requirements imposed on clients to access multiple patients' data using this flexibility must be completely and appropriately documented as per the documentation requirements at ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(viii).</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Background Preamble from <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule [89 FR 1294]: โAdditionally, regarding independently supporting SMART v2 and SMART v1 scopes, we note that this proposal requires the โpermission-v1โ and โpermission-v2โ capabilities as defined in the SMART v2 Guide, which define how such scopes must be supported. We clarify that the SMART v2 Guide scopes must be supported independently of the SMART v1 Guide scopes as per the โpermission-v2โ capability in the SMART v2 Guide, and that the SMART v1 Guide scopes must be supported as per the โpermission-v1โ capability in the SMART v2 Guide. Support for scopes in this manner enables the updated SMART v2 Guide scope syntax to be used by applications while also maintaining backwards compatibility with the SMART v1 Guide scopes for legacy applications.โ</p>
<p>Question: We are seeking confirmation of our understanding on the requirement for support of both "permission-v1" capability encompassing SMART v1 scopes and "permission-v2" capability encompassing SMART v2 scopes. We understand the intent of this requirement to be that the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> server support the ability for an app to use both SMART v1 and SMART v2 scopes to maintain compatibility for apps that are not yet advanced to v2 scopes, but that this would not require that servers somehow support the ability for the same app to utilize both scope sets simultaneously (e.g., using both as part of the same request operation). Is this a correct understanding?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: For certification purposes, a Health IT Module is not required to support authorization requests nor responses including a combination of SMART v1 and SMART v2 scopes. For example, an authorization request including simultaneously the SMART v1 scope of โpatient/Observation.readโ and the SMART v2 scope of โpatient/Condition.rsโ is not required to be supported.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: For the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule requirement to support SMART v2 granular scopes, are we required to enable a user to authorize apps to receive patient data at (1) exclusively the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level or (2) at the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level plus the more finely grained <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> sub-resource level for the specified resources and sub-resource parameters (i.e., Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern and the Observation resource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs).</p>
<p>If we are required to support app authorization at the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level plus the more finely grained <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> sub-resource level for the specified resources and sub-resource parameters, are we required to support this (1) for exclusively patient user scenarios or (2) for both patient and clinician user scenarios?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: For certification and testing purposes the Health IT Module must demonstrate support for patients and users to authorize an app to receive patient data using scopes with โFiner-grained resource constraints using search parametersโ for the sub-resources specified in the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule. We require a Health IT Module to support a patientโs ability to provide authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level.</p>
<p>Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping scopes under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on individual resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes is available, if requested by the patient.</p>
<p>As part of supporting the SMART App Launch โpermission-v2โ capability for the purposes of certification, if an app requests authorization for a resource level scope for the โConditionโ or โObservationโ resources, then for patient authorization purposes a Health IT Module must support presentation of the required sub-resource scopes to the patient for authorization. Specifically, sub-resource scopes must be presented for patient authorization as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: In the context of <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion requirements for SMART v2 granular scopes:</p>
<p>Question 1: In a scenario where an app requests access to retrieve data for the full Condition or Observation resource (i.e., not utilizing a more granular sub-resource scope), is it acceptable for developers to only allow patients ability to approve or deny access at that full <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level. Or, is there an expectation to still provide the ability to approve or deny for the more granular individual sub-resources or a grouped set of sub-resources?</p>
<p>Question 2: The second question relates to supporting the granular scopes control for clinician launch scenarios. Are Health IT Modules required to support presenting scopes in an authorization UI to users for the clinician access for EHR launch SMART capability workflow? Instead, is the option available to provide authorization during the clinician access for EHR launch workflow using granular scopes coordinated during the app registration process?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: To respond to the first question: For the purposes of certification to the ยงโ170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, a Health IT Module must support patient authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level for the sub-resource scopes specified in the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule. Given an app requests a resource level scope for which sub-resource scopes must be supported, the Health IT Module must support a patientโs ability to provide authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level for the sub-resource scopes under that resource level scope. For example, given a โConditionโ resource level scope is requested by an app, the Health IT Module must support patient authorization of individual โEncounter Diagnosisโ, โProblem Listโ, and โHealth Concernโ sub-resource scopes.</p>
<p>To respond to the second question: For purposes of certification to the ยงโ170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, a Health IT Module is not required to support for authorization purposes presentation of sub-resource scopes to the user during clinician access for EHR launch.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: We have three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> final rule preamble there is discussion clarifying that support for wildcard scopes is not mandatory. However, it is referenced in context of the permission-patient capability, which caused some confusion. Permission-patient, as we understand it, is simply the ability to authorize a user to access to a single patientโs record instead of all the patients the user in context has access to (which is what permission-user capability is). So, it is not necessarily specific to a patient access scenario but could be applicable for both patient and clinician access scenarios as evidenced by inclusion in all four capability sets defined at 8.1.1 in the SMART v2 <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr>.  Our assumption is that the intent was actually to clarify that wildcard scopes do not have to be supported for any patient access scenario, whereas they would need to be supported for clinician access scenarios. Is this a correct understanding of the intent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SMART v2 specification was adopted as standard at 170.215(<abbr title="HL7ยฎ SMART App Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0">c)(2</abbr>) specifically citing several optional capabilities, including all โCapabilitiesโ as defined in โ8.1.2 Capabilities,โ excepting the โpermission-onlineโ capability. What is unclear from this is whether all of those capabilities are required to be supported for every persona, or if they are limited to specific relevant ones based on the capability sets defined at 8.1.1.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the context-standalone-patient capability is included as a requirement at 8.1.2 but it is exclusively included in the Patient Access for Standalone Apps capability set at 8.1.1.1. Does the 8.1.2 capabilities requirement compel developers to support context-standalone-patient for both clinician and patient persona launches, or only patient since the equivalent Clinician Access for Standalone capability set at 8.1.1.3 does not include it (even though that capability set is not even required as adopted)?</li>
<li>Similarly, context-ehr-patient and context-ehr-encounter are required as part of the 8.1.2 capabilities, but they are only included in the Clinician Access for EHR Launch capability set at 8.1.1.4 with context-ehr-patient alone included in the Patient Access for EHR Launch (i.e. from Portal) capability set at 8.1.1.2. If either/both of these were required for the patient persona this would indicate that developers must support Patient Access for EHR Launch (i.e. from Portal) even though this capability set was specifically excluded from the requirements (i.e., only โPatient Access for Standalone Appsโ and โClinician Access for EHR Launchโ capability sets are cited in the standard adopted at 170.215(<abbr title="HL7ยฎ SMART App Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0">c)(2</abbr>)).</li>
<li>For one more example, context-standalone-encounter is required as part of the 8.1.2 capabilities but is not included in any capability sets defined at 8.1.1. Itโs unclear whether this would need to be supported for both (or either) personas.</li>
<li>Overall, it seems that the way the SMART v2 requirements were adopted citing certain capability sets at 8.1.1 and then citing all capabilities at 8.1.2 is conflicting. We would recommend <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> consider clarifying that only the 8.1.2 capabilities aligned with the relevant required capability sets are truly required for developers to support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weโre hoping for some clarification on the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> requirement for support of โ3.0.2.3 Finer-grained resource constraints using search parametersโ as part of the SMART v2 standard. The preamble specifically identifies that this requirement was adopted as proposed, which was to require support for more granular resource constraints specifically for โthe โcategoryโ parameter for (1) the Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern and (2) the Observation resource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs.โ The sub-resources identified for the Condition resource are accurate but we believe there may be an issue with those identified for the Observation resource. From reviewing the latest <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> US Core 6.1.0 <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> it appears that the Clinical Test and SDOH options are no longer valid. Accordingly, it would seem that there is a need to instead point to the Observation Category value set as the scope of categories that must be supported as sub-resources.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Can <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> please clarify requirements around patient ability to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level scopes? Is it required that the patient be given the ability to select or deselect individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources? Weโve seen examples of other deployed systems not providing the ability for a patient to select or deselect individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: As part of the โpermission-patientโ โSMART on <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>ยฎ Core Capabilityโ in ยงโ170.215(a)(3), Health IT Modules presented for ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>ยฎ resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level, from one specific <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource (e.g., โImmunizationโ) up to all <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in ยงโ<abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)">170.213</abbr> and implementation specification adopted in ยงโ170.215(a)(2).</p>
<p>Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource-level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping resources under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user, using more granular scopes), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on resource-level scopes is available, if requested by the patient.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Can you provide some more clarification on what is required in (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(1) where systems are expected to support refresh tokens for โno less than 3 months.โ</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion includes requirements for first time connections at ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(1) that a Health IT Moduleโs authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret and native applications capable of securing a refresh token. A requirement for subsequent connections is also included under ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(2) that a Health IT Moduleโs authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months to applications capable of storing a client secret.

<h3 id="2021-inquiries_4">2021 Inquiries<a class="headerlink" href="#2021-inquiries_4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: What is a permissible method of allowing patients to authorize access to individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources, and if this means that the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> server must be able to support requests from client applications for one to all <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> resources; or if it means the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> server must allow the user at the time of authorization to pick/choose which resources are granted access?</p>
<p>Client applications are often designed to request access for their full list and then be granted/denied for the full list and donโt necessarily support this individual selection option at the authorization level. Meaning, they say they need all requested items, and the user can accept that or deny it.</p>
<p>The final rule states that โpatients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level, from one specific <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource (e.g., โImmunizationโ) up to all <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in ยง <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)">170.213</abbr> and implementation specification adopted in ยง 170.215(a)(2).โ</p>
<p>As an example, the client application presents the Immunization, Allergies, Medications, and Problems as the scope of resources they are requesting to access to the server, and this list is then shown to the user for authorization. In light of the requirement above, is it permissible for the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Server to have the user accept the list as a whole (i.e., grant access to Immunization, Allergies, Medications, and Problems) or reject the list as a whole (i.e., denying the client application access to ALL of the resources) but not allow the user to pick/choose which resource they want to be given access?</p>
<p>Or, does the requirement mean the server MUST allow the user to choose which of the specific resources they want to grant access to (e.g., grant access to Immunization, Allergies, and Medications, but donโt grant access to Problems) and the client application must either accept that or deny that?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: A clarification has been issued to the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#ccg">Certification Companion Guide for ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)</a> which states:</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: We have been using the Inferno <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URL Test Kit to validate our <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URLs Bundle however we've found that large bundles cause Inferno Test Framework issues. If the bundle is ~100mb, the browser crashes.</p>
<p>For this scenario would it be possible to attest to a passing Inferno Test run on a subset of our <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URL Bundle JSON? Since the primary goal of the test is to validate data formatting our hope is that a subset of the data would be sufficient for attesting to a passing Inferno Test.</p>
<p>Can <abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> provide any insight or recommendation for vendors running into this problem?</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: The Inferno Service Base URL Test Kit is a voluntary, self-assessment testing tool. Health IT developers may use this testing tool to assist with implementing publishing of service base URLs in a <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Bundle according to the requirements at ยง <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to ยง 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(b)(2). Testing with the Inferno Service Base URL Test Kit is not a requirement for certification nor maintenance of certification. Incomplete and failed test results from this Test Kit do not necessarily indicate non-conformance to the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> maintenance of certification requirements.</p>
<p>As indicated in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inferno-framework/service-base-url-test-kit/issues/22">GitHub issue thread</a>, the Service Base URL Test Kit has received an update which may address the concerns raised. If there are additional questions or feedback regarding this Test Kit, further input may be provided via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inferno-framework/service-base-url-test-kit/issues">GitHub issues</a> in the Test Kit repository or the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthit.gov/feedback">Health IT Feedback and Inquiry Portal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: In Inferno test 4.2.04 (and others) patient data is included in the URL of the HTTP GET request. Is this a Privacy and Security concern?</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: The Inferno testing tool acts as a demanding client to test the conformance of servers to health IT standards. In particular, the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit, which uses Inferno, tests a health IT developer's <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>' conformance to the requirements of the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion. The Inferno implementation provided by <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> on healthit.gov includes a banner indicating it is for demonstration purposes only and must not be used to access sensitive data or Protected Health Information (PHI).</p>
<p>Regarding the privacy and security of the <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> certified to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion, there are numerous privacy and security requirements to protect patient data. The <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit includes tests for conformance to authentication and authorization requirements, such as those detailed in the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/">SMART App Launch Framework</a> and <a target = "_blank" href = "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1.0.1/authorization/index.html">SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide</a>, which require that only authorized clients can access data. Additionally, there are requirements that the connections for data responses for single and multiple patients' data are appropriately secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or above. When used to secure HTTP connections via <a target = "_blank" href = "https://https.cio.gov/faq/#what-does-https-do">HTTPS</a>, TLS protects the confidentiality of the data included in the HTTP URL via encryption, including the URL path and query string parameters (e.g. name and birthdate).</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: We are testing our <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Server using the Inferno (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit. We are failing some Pulse Oximetry Tests. Specifically, in one of our Observation resources, we use dataAbsentReason for 'Inhaled oxygen flow rate'. But Inferno is failing the test mentioning that 'component.value[x].code' is not present in the Observation. Can you provide some clarity on why this is failing?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The Inferno <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit/wiki/FAQ#q-how-does-inferno-test-mustsupport-flag-on-an-element"><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit FAQ</a> includes the following guidance regarding how Inferno tests the "MustSupport" flag on an element.</p>
<p><em>Inferno follows guidance provided by <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Conformance Rules and US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> General Guidance. Inferno checks that a server implementation SHALL demonstrate that it supports the "MustSupport" element in a meaningful way. In general, Inferno "MustSupport" tests check that each "MustSupport" element is present in at least one resource from all resources returned from the server. It is not necessary that one resource contain all MustSupport elements. Inferno does not consider using a "Data Absent Reason" (DAR) extension on a "MustSupport" element as supporting the element "in a meaningful way," so Inferno ignores elements with DAR extensions when looking for "MustSupport" elements.</em></p>
<p>For the Inferno Pulse Oximetry Tests (4.18), the Health IT Module must provide <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources conforming to the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile as specified in the US Core Implementation Guide. The US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile contains elements marked as "MustSupport". As part of the Inferno Pulse Oximetry Tests, the Health IT Module must provide each of these "MustSupport" elements at least once. If at least one cannot be found, the Health IT Module will not pass these tests. Inferno ignores elements with Data Absent Reason extensions when looking for "MustSupport" elements.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Our <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> returns additional resource types in search responses and Inferno ((<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit) is failing us for this. Is this intended to not be allowed? The <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> specification provides flexibility for server search responses.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The Inferno <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit/releases/tag/v2.2.2"><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit v2.2.2</a>, released on 7/11/2022, includes the following update which should resolve the technical concern raised. If your implementation continues to experience this issue, please submit another ticket through the Health IT Feedback and Inquiry Portal.</p>
<p><em>Relaxes constraint that prevented systems from returning additional resource types in search responses. Systems may return other resource types if they believe them to be relevant, and tests now provide informational messages in this case.</em></p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Does <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> have a published list of IP addresses we can whitelist for the (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit hosted at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://inferno.healthit.gov/onc-certification-g10-test-kit">https://inferno.healthit.gov/onc-certification-g10-test-kit</a>?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The IP addresses for <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>'s hosted instance of Inferno are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest Inferno release (inferno.healthit.gov): 52.20.119.0</li>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Do we need to register Inferno as EHR Practitioner App to test <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> certification criteria or we can use SMART Apps like Cardiac Risk to test the criteria? If itโs the Inferno that we need to register for EHR Practitioner App criteria testing, can you please guide me on the workflow on which the EHR practitioner app criteria works for testing in Inferno tool?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: Response to Question 1: <em>Do we need to register Inferno as EHR Practitioner App to test the specific criteria or we can use SMART APPS like Cardiac Risk to test the criteria?</em></p>
<p>Only <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>-approved test methods can be used to test products intended for certification in the Certification Program. Currently, Inferno is the only <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>-approved testing tool for testing compliance to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) "Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for patient and population services" certification criterion. When using Inferno to test compliance to the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, Inferno must be registered with the Health IT Module so that the "EHR Practitioner App" tests in Inferno can be completed.</p>
<p>Response to Question 2: <em>If itโs the Inferno that we need to register for EHR Practitioner App criteria testing, can you please guide me on the workflow on which the EHR practitioner app criteria works for testing in Inferno tool?</em></p>
<p>The "EHR Practitioner App" tests in Inferno require the Health IT Module demonstrate the ability to perform an EHR launch to a SMART on <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> confidential client with patient context, refresh token, and OpenID Connect identity token. After launch, Inferno performs a simple Patient resource read on the patient in context. Inferno then refreshes the access token and reads the Patient resource using the new access token to ensure that the refresh was successful. Finally, Inferno decodes and validates the authentication information provided by OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Additional detail regarding the "EHR Practitioner App" tests in Inferno is available in the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Matrix provided with each Inferno release. The <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certification (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Matrix for the current version of Inferno is available via the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit">onc-certification-g10-test-kit</a> repository on GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: What are the test data requirements for testing to (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) using Inferno?</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The Inferno (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit does not currently require a specific set of data to be entered into the system under test prior to testing. Instead, it leverages <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>'s built-in conformance rules to ensure that data returned is valid, conforms to required profiles, and contains all elements that must be supported. This allows systems to use either their own sample data or supplied sample data.</p>
<p>If needed, Inferno supplies multiple synthetic data sets suitable for testing. These data sets are ideal for testing because they provide coverage of all <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> profiles and support for all "Must Support" data elements without requiring a large set of patients or sacrificing realism. These synthetic data can be generated using the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/inferno-framework/uscore-data-script">uscore-data-script on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a health IT developer can supply their own sample data loaded into the system under test for certification, but the sample data must be able to demonstrate all the conformance requirements for certification according to the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#test_procedure">Test Procedure for 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)</a>. We also encourage health IT developers read the clarifications provided on the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#ccg">Certification Companion Guide for 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Inquiry</strong>: Can Inferno be used for Provider Directory testing? We have been able to use this tool for Patient Access <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> testing.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy">ASTP</abbr> Response</strong>: The Inferno (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit is designed to support the Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for Patient and Population Services certification criterion (ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)) for the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Health IT Certification Program. Since a provider directory is not part of the ยง 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) certification criterion, the Inferno (<abbr title="Standardized HL7ยฎ FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) Standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Test Kit does not support provider directory testing.</p>
<p>However, the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/">Inferno <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Validator</a> tool can be used to validate <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resources against implementation guides, including provider directory <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> implementation guides, like the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Jan/index.html"><abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7ยฎ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>ยฎ Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU 1</a>. Additionally, Inferno is currently being updated to allow for greater extensibility and testing capabilities with a broad array of implementation guides. Support for fully-featured provider directory implementation guide testing may also be added in the future.</p>
