<li>Health IT Modules are not required to support patient-facing <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>-enabled “read” services for multiple patients for the purposes of this certification criterion.</li>
<li>The clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the “Clinical Notes Guidance” section of a US Core Implementation Guide (<abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr>) adopted in § 170.215(b)(1) must be represented in a “plain text” form, and it would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> response. The intent of this policy is to prohibit Health IT Modules from converting clinical notes from a “machine readable” format to a non-“machine readable” format (e.g., PDF). Clinical note text that originates from outside Health IT Modules should be exchanged using its original format.

<li>A Health IT Module must support at least one Choice or Reference for US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> “must support” elements with multiple Choices or References, respectively.</li>
<li>A Health IT Module must be conformant to the US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> for all Choices and References included in its standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, and cannot misrepresent Choices via the standardized <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (e.g. a Health IT Module cannot transform “integer” values to “string” values).</li>
<li>A health IT developer must document which US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> Choices and References are supported by their Health IT Module via public technical documentation to meet the requirements at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(viii) and the transparency conditions at § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(2).</li>
<li>Information originating from the (<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)-certified Health IT Module must conform to the requirements included in the criterion, but legacy information and information from outside systems is not required to be mapped to the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> “Applicable Standards” and the US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> terminologies and value sets. However, health IT developers are encouraged to exceed the minimum requirements described in § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) to support the mapping of legacy information to the terminologies and value sets included in the <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> and US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> where possible.</li>
<li>In order to mitigate potential interoperability errors and inconsistent implementation of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (<abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>®) Bulk Data Access (Flat <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>®) (v1.0.0: STU 1) standard, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> assesses, approves, and incorporates corrections (errata) as part of required certification and testing to this criterion.

US Core “patches” include corrections for issues such as ambiguous requirements and requirements incompatible with real world deployment. Similar to US Core “patches” are US Core “additional guidance”. US Core “additional guidance” approved by the CGP WG indicates guidance included in a newer version of the US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr> as being relevant to a previous version of the US Core <abbr title="Implementation guide">IG</abbr>. Though US Core “patches” and “additional guidance” are not required for certification purposes (unless indicated in the Certification Companion Guide), health IT developers may optionally implement US Core “additional guidance” in their Health IT Module and still be conformant with § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion requirements.</li>

<li>Since the “Patient Access for Standalone Apps” and “Clinician Access for EHR Launch” “Capability Sets” do not include “context-standalone-encounter" <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> will not test Health IT Modules for support for the "context-standalone-encounter" SMART on <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® Capability described in an implementation specification adopted at § 170.215(c).</li>
<li>Implementers of § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of the information blocking provisions.</li>
<li>As part of the requirements at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(1)(iii), health IT developers must publish the method(s) by which their Health IT Modules support the secure issuance of an initial refresh token to native applications according to the technical documentation requirements at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(viii) and transparency conditions at § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(2).</li>

<li>Health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native applications and clarify that health IT developers are not required to support all methods third-party application developers seek to use.</li>
<li><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> recognizes there may be some ambiguity in the <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr>® SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (incorporated by reference at § 170.215(c)) in its guidance for supporting native applications, in particular, in providing references to best practices, strategies, and examples such as “OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps: 8.5. Client Authentication”, “OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol”, and “universal redirect_uris” without a standardized solution. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> provides flexibility for how the health IT developer implements the <abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr>® SMART Application Launch Framework implementation specification, as long as the Certified Health IT Module supports for first time connections the issuance of three-month refresh tokens to native applications capable of securing a refresh token.</li>
<li>The paragraph at § 170.215(c) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (<abbr title="SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0">SMART IG</abbr>) “SMART [on <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>®] Core Capabilities,” including “permission-offline,” which grants support for refresh tokens. The implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(c) require that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization. If the “offline_access” scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires. However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application’s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant “offline-access” scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access.</li>
<li>The SMART capabilities in § 170.215(c) are explicitly required for testing and certification because these capabilities are otherwise indicated as optional in the implementation specification.</li>

<li>As part of the “permission-patient” “SMART on <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® Core Capability” in § 170.215(c), Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their electronic health information (EHI) based on <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® resource level, from one specific <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® resource (e.g., “Immunization”) up to all <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>® resources necessary to implement a standard adopted in § <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)">170.213</abbr> and corresponding implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(b)(1).</li>
<li>As described in the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr>, we encourage implementers to adhere to industry best practices to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other known security threats (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1186">85 FR 25742</a>).

<ul>
<li>For certification purposes, a Health IT Module is not required to support authorization requests nor responses including a combination of SMART v1 and SMART v2 scopes. For example, an authorization request including simultaneously the SMART v1 scope of “patient/Observation.read” and the SMART v2 scope of “patient/Condition.rs” is not required to be supported.</li>
<li>A Health IT Module may optionally support the "fhirContext" launch context parameter defined in the SMART App Launch 2.0.0 implementation guide. If the "fhirContext" parameter is supported, the Health IT Module must conform to the requirements for the parameter detailed in the SMART App Launch implementation guide.</li>
<li>We clarify the following SMART App Launch capabilities must be supported as part of fulfilling the authentication and authorization requirements at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A) when certifying using the implementation specification at § 170.215(<abbr title="HL7® SMART App Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0">c)(2</abbr>):<ul>
<li>To support patient access for standalone apps, the Health IT Module must support:<ul>
<li>the capabilities of "launch-standalone" and "context-standalone-patient"; and</li>
<li>the capabilities in subsections "Authorization Methods", "Client Types", "Single Sign-on", and "Permissions" except the "permission-online" and "permission-user" capabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support clinician access for EHR launch, the Health IT Module must support:<ul>
<li>the capabilities of "launch-ehr", "context-banner", "context-style", "context-ehr-patient", and "context-ehr-encounter" (if supporting <abbr title="United States Core Data for Interoperability">USCDI</abbr> v2 or v3); and</li>

<li>As finalized in the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1250">89 FR 1294</a>), Health IT Modules are required to support SMART App Launch "Finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters" for the “category” parameter for the Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern, and the Observation resource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs. We defer to the implementation guides referenced at § 170.215(b)(1) and § 170.215(c) for specific implementation guidance for this requirement. In the context of the US Core 6.1.0 implementation guide, the Observation sub-resources of Clinical Test and SDOH may have scopes supported as follows:<ul>
<li>support for scopes for the Observation sub-resource Clinical Test using the "procedure" code from the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-clinical-result-observation-category.html">US Core Clinical Result Observation Category value set</a>.</li>
<li>support for scopes for the Observation sub-resource SDOH using the "sdoh" code from the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/CodeSystem-us-core-category.html">US Core Category code system</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The US Core 7.0.0 and 8.0.0 IGs include requirements for how scopes for the Condition and Observation resources must be supported, including  requirements in the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU7/scopes.html#smart-on-fhir-obligations-and-capabilities">“SMART on <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Obligations and Capabilities” section</a> as well as Condition and Observation profiles sections.</li>
<li>For certification and testing purposes the Health IT Module must demonstrate support for patients and users to authorize an app to receive patient data using scopes with “Finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters” for the sub-resources specified in the <abbr title="Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing">HTI-1</abbr> Final Rule. We require a Health IT Module to support a patient’s ability to provide authorization at the individual sub-resource scope level.</li>
<li>Although Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on individual <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes, Health IT Modules are not prohibited from presenting authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format (e.g. grouping scopes under categories, renaming the scopes for easier comprehension by the end-user), as long as the ability for patients to authorize applications based on individual resource level and individual sub-resource level scopes is available, if requested by the patient.</li>
<li>As part of supporting the SMART App Launch “permission-v2” capability for the purposes of certification, if an app requests authorization for a resource level scope for the “Condition” or “Observation” resources, then for patient authorization purposes a Health IT Module must support presentation of the required sub-resource scopes to the patient for authorization. Specifically, sub-resource scopes must be presented for patient authorization as follows:<ul>
<li>“Condition” sub-resource scopes “Encounter Diagnosis”, “Problem List”, and “Health Concern” if a “Condition” resource level scope is requested</li>
<li>“Observation” sub-resource scopes “Clinical Test”, “Laboratory”, “Social History”, “SDOH”, “Survey”, and “Vital Signs” if an “Observation” resource level scope is requested</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For purposes of certification to the § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion, a Health IT Module is not required to support for authorization purposes presentation of sub-resource scopes to the user during clinician access for EHR launch.</li>

By definition, these non-confidential (i.e., "public") native applications do not have a client secret and thus cannot authenticate with the authorization server when receiving access and refresh tokens. However, there are additional methods that non-confidential native applications can use to increase refresh token security during “First time connections.” Methods like Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the use of secure redirect URI schemes<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, and utilizing on-device secure storage techniques to securely store the refresh token can increase the security of an initial refresh token. Methods like these ensure that an authorization server issues initial access and refresh tokens to the correct corresponding authorized application. The paragraph at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(1)(iii) requires that Health IT Modules issue an initial refresh token to native applications capable of securing a refresh token.</p>

On <a href="#first-time-authentication-authorization-for-single-patient-services">first time connections (see sequence diagram above)</a>, an app requests an authorization code and is granted an authorization code after obtaining end-user authorization. An app can then exchange a valid authorization code for an initial access token and initial refresh token.</p>
<p>After an access token expires, an app can subsequently connect to an authorization server to exchange a valid refresh token for a new access token and also have its refresh token renewed without needing to obtain end-user authorization. During both exchanges, security is increased (i.e., greater protection against leaked refresh tokens) when confidential apps use their client secret for client authentication. The (<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) criterion paragraphs at § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(1)(ii) and § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>)(v)(A)(2)(ii) require that apps using the “confidential app” profile and thus capable of authenticating themselves, must be given a refresh token upon valid first time connections and have their refresh tokens renewed upon valid subsequent connections.
